# Objective: Run multiple database queries concurrently using asyncio.gather.

# Instructions:

# Use the aiosqlite library to interact with SQLite asynchronously. To learn more about it, click here.

# Write two asynchronous functions: async_fetch_users() and async_fetch_older_users() that fetches all users and users older than 40 respectively.

# Use the asyncio.gather() to execute both queries concurrently.

# Use asyncio.run(fetch_concurrently()) to run the concurrent fetch

# Fetch all users

            print("All Users:")
            for user in users:
                print(user)

# Fetch users older than 40
